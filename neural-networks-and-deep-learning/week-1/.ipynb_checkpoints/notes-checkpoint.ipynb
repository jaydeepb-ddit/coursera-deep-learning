    "## Introduction to Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This week introduces what are Neural Networks and Deep Learning. It provides a high level overview along with some examples of what is possible with this technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Neural Network?\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network is a universal function approximator that is learned from examples of labelled data. It estimates the label based on the features - using convolutions of non-linear functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network is defined by its architecture and choices of various hyperparameters. The basic unit of computation is a neuron - a *machine* that receives a number of inputs and produces an activated output (via an activation function) from it. Many such neurons can be stacked into more complicated neural network architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of activation function is usually made as a hyperparameter search, one of many well known candidates are tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first set of neurons (called a layer) receive inputs from the input layer of features. These neurons then propogate their outputs to potentially other layers until the final layer, where they estimate the labelled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, when counting layers, the input layer is called layer 0, and so is not counted when computing the total number of layers on a neural network architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "A network may have hidden layers which receive inputs from neurons and output to other neurons that are not the final layer - estimate of the label. These hidden layers can sometimes be interpreted as extracting features at a higher level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, the final layer is estimated as a probability distribution over the range of possible outcomes, but this can be condesed to just a point estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Housing Price Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to estimate the value of a house, based on a large set of historical dataset of houses with characteristics of each house (the *feature*) and its price (the *label*).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### One Feature \n",
    "\n",
    "If we have just one feature that is the size of the house (in square meters), then we can think of a linear regression to find the coefficient and intercept (or bias) that links the size of a house to its price(in USD). \n",
    "\n",
    "This simple model can also be recast as a neural network. It is a network with just 1 input feature and it has just one neuron that predicts the output layer. The activation function is the just the identity, or linear unit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A better activation function would be one that puts a floor on the function of 0, to stop impossible negative house prices.  In such a case, we have what is called a rectified linear unit or RELU - which has become popular in training deep networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now consider how to estimate a house price when we have more features.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Many Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose now we have the same historical dataset, only now we have many features. In that case, we may believe that some features combine (in some non-linear way) and are better at estimating the price.\n",
    "\n",
    "These hidden features can be seen as hidden layers - those that are not directly observed - and modelled using a more flexible network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "We have features house size, bedrooms, zipcode and wealth. We believe that the best output layer has a RELU activation (or it could be learned through hyperparameter search).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also believe that the final price is impacted by walkability, school quality and family size of a house. These are features that we don't directly observe. However, we can use a hidden layer to specify that, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Walkability is a function of zipcode\n",
    "* School quality is a function of zipcode and wealth\n",
    "* Family size is a function of house size and number of bedrooms\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than specifying these relationships exactly, we can set a fully connected feed-forward neural network. The network will learn from data the parameters and hyperparameters that define the actual relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised Learning with Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of the excitement in machine learning is almost exclusively to do with supervised learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Supervised Learning\n",
    "Supervised learning is about learning a good mapping from some input features to a label output (which could be a real number, a class, or a sequence of numbers/strings). Shown enough clear examples, a neural network of sufficient depth can become very good at estimating the output class.  As below there are many examples of this happening in various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "|Input ($\\mathbf{x}$)| Output/Target (\\mathbf{y})| Application | NN Type |\n",
    "|--------------------|---------------------------|-------------|-----------|\n",
    "|Home Features| Price (real number, regression)|Real Estate| Standard FF NN |\n",
    "|Ad, User Info, Clicks| Has Clicked On Advert (0/1,Binary Classification)| Online Advertising| Standard FF NN|\n",
    "|Image| tags (multi class classfication)|Social Media| CNN |\n",
    "|Audio| Text transcript (sequence of words, vector)|Speech Recognition| RNN|\n",
    "|English|Chinese (sequence of words, vector|Machine Translation| RNN | \n",
    "|Image/Radar|Position of Other Cars (3/4 dimensional vector)|Autonomous Driving| CNN with Custom |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structured vs Unstructured Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally the input features can split into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Structured columnar data  of the typee found in SQL\n",
    "* Unstructured data (audio files, images, text) \n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of the hype is coming from unstructured data applications - because traditionally they have been easy for humans and difficult for computers to build mappings on. Much of the success in near human level performance has come from the use of Deep Neural Network applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact unstructured data is usually preprocessed into a columnar data features and then modelled using these Deep Learning strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is Deep Learning Taking Off?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning tools have been around for decades. They are only now taking off for two major reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computer processing power increase (single chip, parallel, GPUs and FPGAs)\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Cheap data storage and access for significantly more data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance vs Data/Model size\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional ML models (Shallow models) have a limit on their perforamnce - after feeding them more compute and data, their performance plateaus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shallow Neural Networks plateaus at a higher perforamnce level, but still can't improve performance substantially given more compute and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learing Neural Networks can keep improving performance given substantially more data and compute to learn bigger networks. These Deep models don't plateau for quite some time, and sometimes they hit plateaued performance well after human level performance has been achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually one will run out of data or the compute will take too long for a giant sized deep neural network. However many applications are achieving excellent success.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Innovations\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been some innovations in the candidate hyperparameters. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use of the RELU activation function to speed up learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* Faster cycling to iterate improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "* Batch Normalizations speeds up learning\n"
