    "## Improving Model Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is having a disciplined machine learning strategy important? Suppose we train a computer algorithm for a machine learning task. Its performance is not acceptable - we need to improve. There are many changes we can try making to the system, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Collect more data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Collect more diverse training data (balance)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Change convergence criteria \n",
    "    - train for more iterations (if using iterative approach)\n",
    "    - train until change is within epsilon\n",
    " \n",
    "* Try different initial parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try different algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try bigger network (more parameters/complexity)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try smaller network (more parameters/complexity)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "* Change Network Architecture\n",
    "    - number of activation units in different layers\n",
    "    - number of hidden layers\n",
    "    - different activation function\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Augmentation\n",
    "    - artificial data\n",
    "    - similar data\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Bootstrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bagging\n",
    " \n",
    "* Boosting \n",
    " \n",
    "* Early Stopping\n",

    "Almost all of these are good ideas - having different effects depending on the reason underlying unacceptable performance. However, without a strategy we could go in circles trying one thing and then another - possibly wasting time and resources and not getting optimal results. \n",
    "\n",
    "A principled way of diagnosing problems and applying remedies leads to better performance which can be reasoned about much sooner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference might be seen as akin to a well trained doctor having good diagnostic tools vs someone with a lot of experience seeing various kinds of illnesses but not having a logical and sound framework to improve with.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important part of applying the right changes is doing them with a sense of fairness - that is that if we change one aspect of the algorithm or data then it should have just one measurable effect on the performance - ideally something that we can reason about.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Orthogonalization\n",
    "\n",
    "In many problems it is convenient to find a set of aspects or system of controls that lets us change one and not change the other controls, only the quantity (for example performance metric) that we are interested in. \n",
    "\n",
    "One example is a co-ordinate system. If we have a set of orthogonal basis vectors then changing the size of one them does not change the others - the basis vectors are perpendicular to each other. If we worked in a non-orthogonal set of basis vectors then change the size of one vector impacts the co-ordinates of the others as well as changing distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another is the controls of a vehicle. Speed and direction are in separate controls (steering wheel and pedals). Changing the speed, influences the distance traveled, but it does not change the direction. Direction also influences the distance, but doesn't affect speed. It is conceivable to create controls that change both direction and speed at the same time, making it much harder to understand and achieve the desired action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, with respect to machine learning performance, we want to have controls that influence performance but not the other controls that we may want to change. Some controls such as \"early stopping\" are not orthogonal to the others and so we don't consider them. We also suggest that one control at a time is changed to see its effect on performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will spend the rest of the course understanding how we can identify the reasons for the poor performance and what changes can be expected from change certain controls.\n",
